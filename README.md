This is my implementation of the game Crumble
http://www.playcrumble.com/

Status as of 10/20/2019:
The game is pretty playable but it is still missing a few features

To do:
add captures
detect if a player has won
add keyboard shortcuts
add undo/redo
implement notations
  Display the move notations for the previous moves
  Import/Export move notations to loard/save a game
  Input using move notations instead of clicking
