This is my implementation of the game Crumble
http://www.playcrumble.com/

Status as of 12/19/2019:
The game is completely playable but there are still some features that I would like to add

For help with building/running the game, look at the Build_Documentation.txt file

To do:
add keyboard shortcuts
Display the move notations for the previous moves
Input using move notations instead of clicking
Add a zoom feature
Add alphabeta engine
Implement draw condition
Implement level crumble (limit to number of splits)
